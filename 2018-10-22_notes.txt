  do we really need to erase / start over?
    can we build on existing work?

post drawing
  its a very multifaceted pose
  hard to tell the angles of things,
    could use a grid / wooden floorboards to give perspective
  if you use a bench instead of a chair,
    then your character's movement will be a lot less constrained.

  could be passed out drunk
  i think the character would be pretending to be drunk,
  but it would be more interesting to actually be passed out,
  because that would give him a weakness.
  or maybe they are barely conscious, but still dangerous?

  a lot of concept artists quickly block out a scene in a 3d program,
    apply lighting, and paint over it
