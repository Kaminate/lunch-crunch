How can the forest tell a story?
If this were uncharted, the rock would have a face carved in it, remembering the
glories of an ancient civilization, now engrained with tree roots curled into every nook and cranny.

Or it's a spooooooky forest with pointy branches.
When I created the scene, I wanted a warm feeling of an adventurers camp,
either huddling together around the glow of a fire, sheltered from the rain under the rock.

Or it's a happy scene, with soft rays of light and shadows highlighting the party


How to design the character?
Google imaging for 'the rolling girls character concept' has the girls standing, but their
poses and facial expressions show their personalities.

idea:

+------+------------------------+-------------------------+
| the  | adjective ( pick 1-2 ) | occupation ( pick 1-2 ) |
+------+------------------------+-------------------------+
| the  | determined happy       | witch thief             |
| the  | calm curious           | swordsman chef          |
| the  | arrogant righteous     | ...                     |
+------+------------------------+-------------------------+

remember that you can take an existing character and adapt it to a new setting.
One Piece does this all the time, especially relevant is the wano country arc
